Sheun - or Shay as most people call him - endeavors to infuse his art with elements of the beautiful harmony between the scientific and spiritual worlds. The Orbital-NFTs project began as an exploration. Based on a simple script of less than 20 lines of code, the orbital trajectory of an object is simulated based on one parameter - the strength of the accelerative force it feels to the center. Randomly varying this parameter produces a whole world of fascinated designs, all claimable as a unique NFT and each of which embodies the healing harmony of science and life. Which one will you discover?"
